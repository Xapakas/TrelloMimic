There are four major test files: one for User, one for Board, one for BList, and one for Card. Other minor classes such as Component and Label are XML-tested in the Card test file, and HasMembersSet and HasMembersList are tested in the Board test file.

Everything should work, including the XML unit tests that were fixed Monday (well technically tuesday, but midnight isnt real anyways)
